<p><strong>A front-end developer is the programmer who is responsible for making a website attractive to the user and, at the same time, working properly.</strong></p>
<p>Its high demand places front-end developer at the top of the ranking of one of the&nbsp;most sought-after professions&nbsp;.&nbsp;What's more, he hardly has unemployment.&nbsp;But beware, because finding a job requires knowing how to train to become a front-end web developer at the level that the world of work requires today.&nbsp;And the most important?&nbsp;Update and stay current, because the tools and techniques that a front-end developer uses are constantly changing and evolving.</p>
<p>But what exactly does a front-end do, and what does it need to know?&nbsp;We reveal it below.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What does a front-end developer do?</strong></h2>
<div class="wp-block-columns" style="text-align: justify;">
<div class="wp-block-column">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>A front-end developer&nbsp;<strong>works the user interface from the code point of view, so that interaction with the system is possible</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Therefore, it takes care of the visual part of the web (everything you can see in your browser) making its design intuitive and attractive.</p>
<p>But be careful, because, although it may seem like it, the&nbsp;<strong>front-end is not a designer</strong>&nbsp;, but rather&nbsp;<strong>collects the documents and guidelines of the design team to translate them into code</strong>&nbsp;and, chas!, it does its magic turning those ideas into reality.&nbsp;Therefore, that the developer knows the&nbsp;<em>basics</em>&nbsp;of good graphic and interactive design will be a plus for his performance.</p>
<p>After all, their work is closely linked to that of UX designers and back-end developers.&nbsp;The difference with the latter?&nbsp;We can say that the back-end is the 'hidden face', since it is development from the server, the creation of code that allows the operation of a website;&nbsp;while the front-end (front development)&nbsp;<strong>works from the client side</strong>&nbsp;, interpreting and adapting web development languages ​​to create the final experience of that client/user:&nbsp;<strong>it is the way in which the design is actually implemented on the web.</strong></p>
<p>A front-end developer, in addition to defining the structure of the web, must facilitate user navigation, taking into account the usability and legibility of the web or app.&nbsp;Thus, the connection and&nbsp;<strong>good communication</strong>&nbsp;of the front-end web developer with his allies is key: the UX designer and the backend developer.</p>
<h3>Front End Developer Features</h3>
<p>Therefore, the functions of the front-end could be summarized in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translate designs to programming language.</li>
<li>Develop the visual part and structure of a web site or app, as well as maintain and optimize web sites and apps and user interfaces.</li>
<li>Facilitate user navigation and improve usability and interaction with the site on any device or browser (check web loading time, make responsive designs, write maintainable code, ensure web accessibility...).</li>
<li>Take care of the external components of the site or web app and manage the workflow of the software.</li>
<li>Implement SEO practices on page.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>One of the main tasks of the front-end is to make sure that your website is&nbsp;<em>cross-browser</em>&nbsp;(looks good in different browsers),&nbsp;<em>cross-platform</em>&nbsp;(on different operating systems) and&nbsp;<em>cross-device</em> (on different devices).</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Requirements to be a front-end developer</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At this point, it is logical that you ask yourself how to become a front-end developer, what do I need to be a front-end?&nbsp;It's very complicated?&nbsp;We already told you no, but take note to find the training keys and those characteristics that you should meet to reach your goal:</p>
<div class="wp-block-columns" style="text-align: justify;">
<div class="wp-block-column">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="wp-block-column">
<ol>
<li>Master the programming languages&nbsp;<strong>​​HTML, CSS and&nbsp;JavaScript</strong>&nbsp;to be able to apply the design to the web or app that is proposed.&nbsp;By the way, do you know which are the&nbsp;most used programming languages&nbsp;?</li>
<li>Have knowledge about&nbsp;<strong>layout and design theories:</strong>&nbsp;don't forget that you work on the visible side for the client, so you have to create efficient and attractive pages.</li>
<li>Have skills in&nbsp;<strong>visual design and UX design.</strong></li>
<li>Know how to work with&nbsp;<strong>frameworks, design patterns and CMS.</strong></li>
<li>Know the work of&nbsp;<strong>backend and UX design,</strong>&nbsp;since their jobs are interconnected and they must have good communication with the members of these teams.</li>
<li>Know in depth&nbsp;<strong>GIT</strong>&nbsp;(a version control system, a collaborative tool between developers).</li>
<li>Know how to&nbsp;<strong>optimize the resources</strong>&nbsp;consumed by an app, through the server.</li>
<li>Know how to integrate&nbsp;<strong>SEO on page</strong>&nbsp;in web development.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can see, it is a profile with&nbsp;technical knowledge in programming&nbsp;to which is added the creative capacity to translate information in an interactive, functional and visually attractive way.&nbsp;But beware!&nbsp;Because a front-end should also have a series of&nbsp;<strong>key soft skills such</strong>&nbsp;as good taste, organization, adaptability, curiosity, teamwork and self-learning.</p>
